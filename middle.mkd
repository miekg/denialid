# Introduction
DNSSEC can be somewhat of a complicated matter, and there are certain areas 
of the specification that are more difficult to comprehend than others.
One such area is "authenticated denial of existence".

Authenticated denial of existence allows a DNSSEC enabled resolver to
validate that a certain domain name does not exist.
It is also used to signal that a domain
name exists, but does not have the specific RR type you were asking for.

The first is referred to as an NXDOMAIN [](#RFC2308) (non-existent domain) and the 
latter a NODATA [](#RFC2308) response.

In this document we will explain how authenticated denial
of existence works.
We begin by explaining the current technique in the DNS
and work our way up to DNSSEC. We explain the first steps
taken in DNSSEC and describe how NXT, NSEC and NSEC3 work. NO, NSEC2 and
DNSNR also briefly make their appearance, as they have paved the
way for NSEC3.

To complete the picture we also need to explain DNS wildcards
as these complicate matters.

Note: In this document domain names in zone file examples will have a trailing dot, in the
running text they will not.
This text is written for people who have a fair understanding
of DNSSEC. This document does not explain NSEC3 opt-out and secure delegations.

The following RFCs are not required reading, but they help in
understanding the problem space.

* RFC 5155 [](#RFC5155) - Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existence;
* RFC 4592 [](#RFC4592) - The Role of Wildcards in the DNS.

And these provide some general DNSSEC information.

* RFC 4033, RFC 4034, RFC 4035 [](#RFC4033), [](#RFC4034), [](#RFC4035) - DNSSEC Spec;
* RFC 4956 [](#RFC4956) - DNS Security (DNSSEC) Opt-In. This RFC has experimental 
    status, but is a good read.

These three drafts give some background information on the NSEC3
development.

* The NO RR [](#I-D.ietf-dnsext-not-existing-rr);
* The NSEC2 RR [](#I-D.laurie-dnsext-nsec2v2);
* The DNSNR RR [](#I-D.arends-dnsnr).

# Denial of Existence
We start with the basics and take a look at
NXDOMAIN handling in the DNS. To make it more visible
we are going to use a small DNS zone, with
3 names (`example.org`, `a.example.org` and `d.example.org`) and 3 types (SOA,
A and TXT). For brevity the class is not shown (defaults to IN), the
NS records are left out and the SOA and RRSIG records are shortened, resulting
in the following unsigned zone file:

    example.org.        SOA ( ... )
    a.example.org.      A 192.0.2.1
                        TXT "a record"
    d.example.org.      A 192.0.2.1
                        TXT "d record"

## NXDOMAIN
If a resolver asks for the TXT type belonging to `a.example.org` to the
name server serving this zone, it sends the following question: `a.example.org TXT`

The name server looks in its zone data and
generates an answer. In this case a positive one: "Yes it exists
and this is the data", resulting in this reply:

    ;; status: NOERROR, id: 28203

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    a.example.org.      TXT "a record"

    ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
    example.org.        NS a.example.org.


The `status: NOERROR` signals that everything is OK, `id` is an integer
used to match questions and answers. In the ANSWER section we find
our answer. The AUTHORITY section holds the names of the name servers
that have information concerning the `example.org` zone. Note that including
this information is optional.

If a resolver asks for `b.example.org TXT` it gets an answer that
this name does not exist:

    ;; status: NXDOMAIN, id: 7042

    ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
    example.org.        SOA ( ... )

In this case we do not get an ANSWER section and the status
is set to NXDOMAIN. From this the resolver concludes that `b.example.org` does not
exist.

## NODATA
It is important to realize that NXDOMAIN is not the only type
of does-not-exist. A name may exist, but the type you are asking
for may not. This occurrence of non-existence is called a NODATA [](#RFC2308) response.
Let us ask our name server for `a.example.org AAAA`, and look at the
answer:

    ;; status: NOERROR, id: 7944

    ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
    example.org.        SOA ( ... )

The status is NOERROR meaning that the `a.example.org` name exists.
But the reply does not contain an ANSWER section. Instead it has
an AUTHORITY section which holds the SOA record of `example.org`. The resolver
has to put these pieces of information together and conclude that
`a.example.org` exists, but it does not have an `AAAA` record.

# Secure Denial of Existence
The above has to be translated to the security aware world
of DNSSEC. But there are a few requirements DNSSEC brings to the table:

1. There is no online signing defined in DNSSEC. Although a
    name server is free to compute the answer and signature(s)
    on-the-fly,
    the protocol is written with a "first sign, then load" 
    attitude in mind.
    It is rather asymmetrical, but a lot of the design in DNSSEC
    stems from fact that you need to accommodate authenticated
    denial of existence. If the DNS didn't have NXDOMAIN, DNSSEC would be a
    lot simpler, but a lot less useful!

2. The DNS packet header is not signed. 
    This means that a `status: NXDOMAIN` 
    can not be trusted. In fact the entire header may be forged, including
    the AD bit (AD stands for Authentic Data, see RFC 3655 [](#RFC3655)), 
    which may give some food for thought;

3. DNS wildcards complicate matters significantly. More
    about this in later sections ([](#wildcards-in-the-dns)).

The first requirement implies that all denial of existence answers need to be 
pre-computed, but it is impossible to precompute (all conceivable) non-existence answers.
In the example above, you need
a way to tell somebody who is asking for `b.example.org` that it
does not exist without using the name `b.example.org` in the
answer. 
This has been solved by introducing a record that defines an
interval between two existing names. Or to put it another way: it
defines the holes (non-existing names) in the zone. This record can 
be signed beforehand and given to the resolver.

If the packet header is not signed (as per the second requirement),
why can't we just work around this by including in each NXDOMAIN response
a *generic* signed record which denies the existence of whichever record was
requested? It turns out that such a naive attempt at authenticated
denial of existence is susceptible to replay attacks: When you're querying
a nameserver for a record which actually exists, a man in the middle may
replay that generic signed NXDOMAIN response and it would be impossible
to tell whether that response was genuine or forged by the man in the middle.
Consequently, the NXDOMAIN response has to be specific to the record requested.

The road to the current solution (NSEC/NSEC3) was long. It
started with the NXT (next) record. The NO (not existing) record was introduced,
but never made it to RFC. Later on, NXT was superseded by the
NSEC (next secure) record. From there it went through NSEC2/DNSNR to finally reach
NSEC3 (next secure, version 3) in RFC 5155.

## NXT ##
The first attempt to specify authenticated denial of existence was NXT 
(RFC 2535 [](#RFC2535)).  Section 5.1 of that RFC introduces the record:

> "The NXT resource record is used to securely indicate that RRs with an
> owner name in a certain name interval do not exist in a zone and to
> indicate what RR types are present for an existing name."

By specifying what you do have, you implicitly tell what you don't have. NXT
is superseded by NSEC. In the next section we explain how NSEC (and thus NXT) works.

## NSEC ##
In RFC 3755 [](#RFC3755) all the DNSSEC types were given new names, SIG was renamed RRSIG,
KEY became DNSKEY and NXT was simply renamed to NSEC and a few minor 
issues were fixed in the process.

Just as NXT, NSEC is used to describe an interval
between names: it indirectly tells a resolver which names do not exist in
a zone.

For this to work, we need our `example.org` zone to be sorted in canonical order
([](#RFC4034), Section 6.1), and then create the NSECs.
We add three NSEC records, one for each name, and each one "covers" a certain
interval. The last NSEC record points back to the first as required by the RFC. Also
see [](#fig:the-nsec-r).

1. The first NSEC covers the interval between `example.org` and
   `a.example.org`;
2. The second NSEC covers `a.example.org` to `d.example.org`;
3. The third NSEC points back to `example.org`, and covers `d.example.org` to
   `example.org` (i.e. the end of the zone).

As we have defined the intervals and put those in resource
records, we now have something that can be signed.

                        example.org
                           **
                       +-- ** <--+

                     /  .      .   \
                    |  .        .  |
                    v .          . |
                    **    (2)     **
      a.example.org ** ---------> ** d.example.org
      Figure: The NSEC records of example.org. The arrows represent NSEC records, starting
      from the apex.

This signed zone is loaded into the name server. It looks like this:

    example.org.        SOA ( ... )
                        DNSKEY ( ... )
                        NSEC a.example.org. SOA NSEC DNSKEY RRSIG
                        RRSIG(SOA) ( ... )

                        RRSIG(A) ( ... )
                        RRSIG(TXT) ( ... )
                        RRSIG(NSEC) ( ... )
    d.example.org.      A 192.0.2.1
                        TXT "d record"
                        NSEC example.org. A TXT NSEC RRSIG
                        RRSIG(A) ( ... )
                        RRSIG(TXT) ( ... )
                        RRSIG(NSEC) ( ... )
    Figure: The signed example.org zone.

If a DNSSEC aware resolver asks for `b.example.org`, it gets
back a `status: NXDOMAIN` packet, which by itself is meaningless
as the header can be forged. To be able to securely detect that `b` does not exist,
there must also be an NSEC record which *covers* the name space
where `b` lives:

    a.example.org.      NSEC d.example.org.
    
does just do that: `b`
should come after `a`, but the next owner name is `d.example.org`, so
`b` does not exist.

Only by making that calculation, can a resolver conclude that the name
`b` does not exist. If the signature of the NSEC record is valid, `b`
is proven not to exist. We have *authenticated denial of existence*.

Note that a man in the middle may still replay this NXDOMAIN response
when you're querying for, say, c.example.org. But it would not do any
harm since it is provably the proper response to the query.

## NODATA Responses
NSEC records are also used in NODATA responses. In that case we need to look more closely 
at the type bit map. The
type bit map in an NSEC record tells which types are defined for
a name. If we look at the NSEC record of `a.example.org` (see the reply
below or [](#fig:the-signed) for an example of the record) we
see the following types in the bit map: A, TXT, NSEC and RRSIG. So
for the name `a` this indicates we must have an A, TXT, NSEC and RRSIG record in the
zone. 

With the type bit map of the NSEC record a resolver can establish
that a name is there, but the type is not. A resolver
asks for `a.example.org AAAA`. This is the reply that comes
back:

    ;; status: NOERROR, id: 44638

    ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
    example.org.        SOA ( ... )
    example.org.        RRSIG(SOA) ( ... )
    a.example.org.      NSEC d.example.org. A TXT NSEC RRSIG
    a.example.org.      RRSIG(NSEC) ( ... )

Now the resolver should check the AUTHORITY section and conclude that: 

1. `a.example.org` exists (because of the NSEC with that owner name) and;
2. that the type (AAAA) does not as it is not listed in the type bit map.

The techniques used by NSEC are the basics of authenticated denial of
existence in DNSSEC.

But there were two issues with NSEC (and NXT).
The first is that it allows for zone walking. NSEC
records point from one name to another, in our example: `example.org`, points
to `a.example.org` which points to `d.example.org` which points back to
`example.org`. So we can reconstruct the entire `example.org` zone even when 
zone transfers (AXFR) on the server are denied. 

The second issue is that when a large, delegation heavy,
zone deploys DNSSEC, every name in the zone gets an NSEC plus
RRSIG. This leads to a huge increase in the zone
size (when signed). This would in turn mean that operators of large zones (or with a lot
of zones) who are deploying DNSSEC, face up front costs. This could hinder DNSSEC adoption.

These two issues eventually lead to NSEC3 which:

* Adds a way to garble the next owner name, thus thwarting zone-walking;
* Makes it possible to skip names for the next owner name. This feature
  is called opt-out. It means not all names in your zone get an NSEC3 plus
  ditto signature, making it possible to "grow into" your DNSSEC deployment. Describing
  opt-out is out of scope for this document. For those interested,
  opt-out is explained in RFC 4956 [](#RFC4956), which is curiously titled "(DNSSEC) Opt-In".
  Later this was incorporated into RFC 5155 [](#RFC5155).

But before we delve into NSEC3, let us first take a look at its predecessors: NO, NSEC2
and DNSNR.

## NO, NSEC2 and DNSNR ##
The NO record was the first to introduce the idea of hashed owner names. It also fixed other shortcomings
of the NXT record. At the time (around 2000) zone walking was not considered important enough
to warrant the new record. People were also worried that deployment would be hindered by
developing an alternate means of denial of existence. Thus the effort was shelved and
NXT remained. When the new DNSSEC specification was written, NSEC saw the light and
inherited the two issues from NXT.

Several years after that NSEC2 was introduced as a way to solve the two issues
of NSEC. The NSEC2 draft contains the following paragraph:

> "This document proposes an alternate scheme which hides owner names
> while permitting authenticated denial of existence of non-existent
> names.  The scheme uses two new RR types: NSEC2 and EXIST."

When an authenticated denial of existence scheme starts to talk
about EXIST records it is worth paying extra attention.

NSEC2 solved the zone walking issue, by hashing (with SHA1 and a salt) the
"next owner name" in the record, thereby making it useless for zone walking.

But it did not have opt-out. Although promising, the proposal
did not make it because of issues with wildcards and the odd EXIST
resource record.

The DNSNR RR was another attempt that used hashed names to
foil zone walking and it also introduced the concept of opting out (called
"Authoritative Only Flag") which limited the use of DNSNR in delegation heavy zones.
This proposal didn't make it either, but it provided valuable insights into the
problem.

## NSEC3 ##
From the experience gained with NSEC2 and DNSNR, NSEC3 was forged. It incorporates
both opt-out and the hashing of names. NSEC3 solves any issues people might
have with NSEC, but it introduces some additional complexity.

NSEC3 did not supersede NSEC, they are both defined for
DNSSEC. So DNSSEC is blessed with two different means to perform authenticated
denial of existence: NSEC and NSEC3. 
In NSEC3 every name is hashed, including the owner name.

SHA1 is always used for
the hashing. To make it even more difficult to retrieve the original names,
the hashing can be repeated several times each time taking the previous hash
as input. To thwart rainbow table attacks, a custom salt is also added. In the NSEC3
for `example.org` we have hashed the names twice and use the salt `DEAD`.
Lets look at typical NSEC3 record:

    15BG9L6359F5CH23E34DDUA6N1RIHL9H.example.org. (
       NSEC3 1 0 2 DEAD A6EDKB6V8VL5OL8JNQQLT74QMJ7HEB84
            SOA RRSIG DNSKEY NSEC3PARAM )

On the first line we see the hashed owner name: `15BG9L6359F5CH23E34DDUA6N1RIHL9H.example.org`, this
is the hashed name of `example.org`. Note that even though we hashed `example.org`, the 
zone's name is added to make it look like a domain name again. 
The basic format is `SHA1(example.org).example.org`.

The next hashed owner name `A6EDKB6V8VL5OL8JNQQLT74QMJ7HEB84` (line 2) is the hashed version of `d.example.org`.
Note that `.example.org` is not added to the next hashed owner name, as this
name always falls in the current zone.

The "1 0 2 DEAD" section of the NSEC3 states: 

* Hash Algorithm = 1 (SHA1, this is the default, no other hash algorithms are currently defined for 
    use in NSEC3); 
* Opt Out = 0 (disabled);
* Hash Iterations = 2; 
* Salt = "DEAD". 

At the end we see the type bit map, which is identical to NSEC's bit map, that
lists the types present at the original owner name. Note that the type NSEC3
is absent from the list in the example above. This is due to the fact that the
original owner name (`example.org`) does not have the NSEC3 type. It only exists
for the hashed name.

You may be wondering why the next hashed owner of `example.org` is
`d.example.org`, unlike NSEC where the next owner name was `a.example.org`.
This is because NSEC3 sorts the names in the zone not by the original owner
name but by the hashed owner name. So in our tiny example zone, the sorted
list looks like this: 04SKNAPCA5AL7QOS3KM2L9TL3P5OKQ4C (a.example.org),
15BG9L6359F5CH23E34DDUA6N1RIHL9H (example.org),
A6EDKB6V8VL5OL8JNQQLT74QMJ7HEB84 (d.example.org). See [](#list-of-hashed-owner-names)
for all complete list of hashes.

If you have understood the fundamental concept of NSEC -- signing the gaps
between existing names -- then NSEC3 may seem counter-intuitive:
When hashing two consecutive owner names, there may always be
other owner names in the zone whose hashed version falls between the two
resulting hashes. Or, generally speaking, the following is clearly not
true: SHA1(x) < SHA1(y) for all x < y. In fact, if we hash `a.example.org`
and `d.example.org`, which are consecutive in unhashed form, the hash of
`example.org` falls between them. So how can it work?

As it turns out, it does not matter that the order of the owner names
is mixed up by the hashing. Remember that all we want to achieve is
thwarting replay attacks. Let's assume that you're querying for a name
that actually exists and a man in the middle sends you an NSEC3 record
as a response. For the attack to be successful, the hashed version of
the name you where asking for has to fall between the hashed owner name
and the next hashed owner of the NSEC3 record. By definition, that
can't be true and the attack will therefore fail. So whereas NSEC signs
the gaps between existing names, NSEC3 signs the gaps between the hashed
versions of existing names.

Names like `1.h.example.org` hash to one label in NSEC3,
`1.h.example.org` becomes: `117GERCPRCJGG8J04EV1NDRK8D1JT14K.example.org` when
used as an owner name.  This is an important observation. 
By hashing the names you lose the depth of a zone - hashing
introduces a flat space of names, as opposed to NSEC.

The domain name used above (`1.h.example.org`) creates an empty non-terminal. 
Empty non-terminals are domain names that have no RRs associated with them, and exist only
because they have one or more sub domains that do ([](#RFC5155), Section 1.3). 

        1.h.example.org.    TXT "1.h record"

Creates 2 names:

1. `1.h.example.org` that has the type: TXT;
2. `h.example.org` which has no types. This is the empty non-terminal. An empty
   non-terminal will get an NSEC3 records, but not an NSEC record.

## Loading an NSEC3 Zone into an Authoritative Server
Whenever an authoritative server receives a query for a non-existing record,
it has to hash the incoming query name to determine into which interval
between two existing hashes it falls. To do that it needs to know the
zone's specific NSEC3 parameters (hash iterations and salt).

One way to learn them is to scan the zone during loading for NSEC3 records and glean
the NSEC3 parameters from them.  However, it would need to make sure that there
is at least one complete set of NSEC3 records for the zone using the same
parameters. Therefore, it would need to inspect all NSEC3 records.

A more graceful solution was designed. 
This solution was to create a new record, NSEC3PARAM, which must be placed at
the apex of the zone.  Its sole role is to provide a single, fixed place
where an authoritative name server can directly see the NSEC3 parameters used.
If NSEC3 were designed in the early days of
DNS (+/- 1985) this information would probably have been put in the SOA record.

## Wildcards in the DNS ##
In the above sections we have not revealed the entire story. There is a complication: wildcards.
Wildcards have been part of the DNS since the first DNS RFCs. They allow to define
*all* names for a certain type in one go. In our `example.org` zone we could for instance
add a wildcard record:

    *.example.org.      TXT "wildcard record"

For completeness, our (unsigned) zone now looks like this:

    example.org.        SOA ( ... )
    *.example.org.      TXT "wildcard record"
    a.example.org.      A 192.0.2.1
                        TXT "a record"
    d.example.org.      A 192.0.2.1
                        TXT "d record"

<!-- * keep vim's syntax happy --> If a resolver asks for `z.example.org TXT`, 
the name server will respond with an *expanded wildcard*, instead of an NXDOMAIN:

    ;; status: NOERROR, id: 13658

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    z.example.org.      TXT "wildcard record"
    
Note however that the resolver can not detect that this answer came from a wildcard. It just
sees the answer as-is. How will this answer look with DNSSEC?

    ;; status: NOERROR, id: 51790

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    z.example.org.      TXT "wildcard record"
    z.example.org.      RRSIG(TXT) ( ... )

    ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
    d.example.org.      NSEC example.org. A TXT RRSIG NSEC
    d.example.org.      RRSIG(NSEC) ( ... )

The RRSIG of the `z.example.org` TXT record indicates there is a wildcard configured. The RDATA of
the signature lists a label count [](#RFC4034), Section 3.1.3., of two (not visible in the answer above),
but the owner name of the signature has three labels. 
This mismatch indicates there is a wildcard configured for the
name `*.example.org`.

The AUTHORITY section holds an NSEC *even though* it is not an NXDOMAIN nor an NODATA reply.
This NSEC proves that the queried name
`z.example.org` does not exist, and wildcard name expansion was
indeed allowed.

The DNSSEC standard mandates that an NSEC (or NSEC3) is included in such responses.
If it wasn't, an attacker could mount a replay attack and poison the cache with false data:

 Suppose that the resolver has asked for
`a.example.org TXT`, an attacker could modify the packet in such way that it looks
like the response was generated through wildcard expansion, even though
there exists a record for `a.example.org TXT`: `a.example.org.  TXT "a record"`

The tweaking simply consists of adjusting the ANSWER section to:

    ;; status: NOERROR, id: 31827

    ;; ANSWER SECTION
    a.example.org.      TXT "wildcard record"
    a.example.org.      RRSIG(TXT) ( ... )

Which would be a perfectly valid answer if we would not require the 
inclusion of an NSEC or NSEC3 record in the wildcard answer response. The resolver
believes that `a.example.org TXT` is a wildcard record, and the real record
is obscured. This is bad and defeats all the security DNSSEC
can deliver. Because of this, the NSEC or NSEC3 must be present.

Thus a resolver can detect such a spoofing attempt:

1. If the NSEC(3) is not present, assume the answer is spoofed;
2. If the NSEC(3) is there, check it. If the signature is not correct,
   assume a spoofed answer.

Another way of putting this is that DNSSEC is there to ensure
the name server has followed the steps as outlined in [](#RFC1034), Section 4.3.2
for looking up names in the zone. 
It explicitly lists wildcard look up as one of these steps (3c), so with DNSSEC this must be
communicated to the resolver: hence the NSEC(3) record.

With NSEC the maximum number of NSEC records a resolver can get back is
two: one for the denial of existence and another for the wildcard.
We say maximum, because sometimes a single NSEC can prove both.
With NSEC3 it is three, as to why, we will explain in the next 
section.

## Returning Three NSEC3s
With NSEC3, matters are even more complicated. 
So we have an NSEC3 that denies the existence of the requested name and
an NSEC3 that denies wildcard synthesis. What do we miss?

The short answer is that due to the hashing in NSEC3 you loose the depth
of your zone: Everything is hashed into a flat plane. To make up for this
loss of information you need an extra record.
The more detailed explanation is quite a bit longer...

To understand NSEC3 we will need two definitions:

Closest encloser:

:   Introduced in [](#RFC4592),
    "The closest encloser is the node in the zone's tree of existing
    domain names that has the most labels matching the query name
    (consecutively, counting from the root label downward)."
    If the query name is `x.2.example.org`
    then `example.org` is the `closest encloser` in our example;

Next closer name:

:   Introduced in the NSEC3 RFC, this is the closest encloser with one more label added to the left.
    So if `example.org` is the closest encloser for the query name `x.2.example.org`, `2.example.org` is 
    the `next closer name`.

An NSEC3 `closest encloser proof` consists of:

1. An NSEC3 RR that **matches** the `closest encloser`. This means the
   unhashed owner name of the record is the closest encloser. This bit of
   information tells a resolver: "The name you are asking for does 
   not exist, the closest I have is this". 

2. An NSEC3 RR that **covers** the `next closer name`. This means it
   defines an interval in which the `next closer name` falls. This
   tells the resolver: "The name in your question falls in
   this interval, and therefore the name in your question does not exist. In fact,
   the closest encloser is indeed the closest I have".

Take the following example. We take our zone, but now with the following
two records and it is signed with NSEC3. 
As said these records create two non-terminals: "h.example.org" and "3.example.org",
but that is irrelevant for the theory here.

    1.h.example.org.    TXT "1.h record"
    3.3.example.org.    TXT "3.3 record"

The complete unsigned zone now looks like this.

    example.org.        SOA ( ... )
    1.h.example.org.    TXT "1.h record"
    3.3.example.org.    TXT "3.3 record"

The resolver asks the following: `x.2.example.org TXT`.
This leads to an NXDOMAIN response from the server, which contains
three NSEC3 records. A list of hashed owner names
can be found in [](#list-of-hashed-owner-names).
Also see [](#fig:x.2.exampl) the numbers in the figure correspond
with the following NSEC3 records:

    15BG9L6359F5CH23E34DDUA6N1RIHL9H.example.org. (
     NSEC3 1 0 2 DEAD 1AVVQN74SG75UKFVF25DGCETHGQ638EK SOA 
            RRSIG DNSKEY NSEC3PARAM )

    75B9ID679QQOV6LDFHD8OCSHSSSB6JVQ.example.org. (
     NSEC3 1 0 2 DEAD 8555T7QEGAU7PJTKSNBCHG4TD2M0JNPJ TXT
            RRSIG )

    1AVVQN74SG75UKFVF25DGCETHGQ638EK.example.org. (
        NSEC3 1 0 2 DEAD 75B9ID679QQOV6LDFHD8OCSHSSSB6JVQ )

If we would follow the NSEC approach, the resolver is only interested in
one thing.
Does the hash of `x.2.example.org` fall in any of the intervals of 
the NSEC3 records it got?

                        example.org
                           ** 
                       +-- ** .....................
                  (1) /  . /\ .                    .
                     /  .  |   .                    .
                    |  .   |    .                    .
                    v .    |     .                    . 
                    **     |      **                  ++
      h.example.org ** ----+----> ** 3.example.org    ++ 2.example.org
                    .     /   (3)  . |                .
                    .    /         . | (2)            . 
                    .   /          . |                .
                    .  /           . v                .
    1.h.example.org **            **                  ++ 
                    ** <--------- ** 3.3.example.org  ++ x.2.example.org
    Figure: x.2.example.org does not exist. The arrows represent the NSEC3 records, the ones
    numbered (1), (2) and (3) are the NSEC3s returned in our answer.

The hash of `x.2.example.org` is `NDTU6DSTE50PR4A1F2QVR1V31G00I2I1`.
Checking this hash on the first NSEC3 yields that it does not fall
in between the interval: `15BG9L6359F5CH23E34DDUA6N1RIHL9H`
and `1AVVQN74SG75UKFVF25DGCETHGQ638EK`.
For the second NSEC3 the answer is also negative: the hash sorts outside
the interval described by `75B9ID679QQOV6LDFHD8OCSHSSSB6JVQ` and
`8555T7QEGAU7PJTKSNBCHG4TD2M0JNPJ`.
And the last NSEC3 also isn't of any help.
What is a resolver to do? It has been given the maximum amount of NSEC3s and 
they all seem useless.

A question that you might have at this point is why does the server not send an NSEC3
that covers the hash of `x.2.example.org`, so the resolver can validate in one step? 
While this indeed denies the existence of `x.2.example.org` it is only half the
answer. As explained, a denial of existence answer needs to say something about
whether or not a wildcard should have been expanded. And to communicate
which wildcard could have been, you need to tell the resolver what the closest encloser
is. 

So this is where the closest encloser proof comes into play. And for the proof
to work, the resolver needs to know what the `closest encloser` is. There must
be an existing ancestor in the zone: a name must exist that is shorter than the
query name. The resolver keeps hashing increasingly shorter names from
the query name until an owner name of an NSEC3 matches. This owner name is
the `closest encloser`.

When the resolver has found the closest encloser, the next step is
to construct the `next closer name`. This is the closest encloser
with the last chopped label from query name prepended to it:
"\<last chopped label\>.\<closest encloser\>". The hash of this name should 
be covered by the interval set in any of the other NSEC3 records.

Then the resolver needs to check the presence of a wildcard.
It creates the wildcard name by prepending the wildcard
label to the closest encloser: "*.\<closest encloser\>", and uses the
hash of that.

Going back to our example the resolver must first detect the NSEC3 that
matches the closest encloser. It does this by chopping up the query name,
hashing each instance (with the same number of iterations and hash
as the zone it is querying) and comparing that to the answers
given. So it has the following hashes to work with:

`x.2.example.org`: 

:   `NDTU6DSTE50PR4A1F2QVR1V31G00I2I1`, last chopped label: "\<empty\>";

`2.example.org`: 

:   `7T70DRG4EKC28V93Q7GNBLEOPA7VLP6Q`, last chopped label: "x";

`example.org`: 

:   `15BG9L6359F5CH23E34DDUA6N1RIHL9H`, last chopped label: "2";

Of these hashes only one matches the owner name of one of the NSEC3
records: `15BG9L6359F5CH23E34DDUA6N1RIHL9H`. This must be the closest
encloser (unhashed: `example.org`). That's the main purpose of that NSEC3 record:
tell the resolver what the closest encloser is.

From that knowledge the resolver constructs the next closer, which
in this case is: `2.example.org`; `2` is the last label chopped, when `example.org` is the closest
encloser.
The hash of this name should be
covered in any of the other NSEC3s. And it is, `7T70DRG4EKC28V93Q7GNBLEOPA7VLP6Q` falls in the interval
set by: `75B9ID679QQOV6LDFHD8OCSHSSSB6JVQ` and `8555T7QEGAU7PJTKSNBCHG4TD2M0JNPJ` (this is our second NSEC3).

So what does the resolver learn from this?

* `example.org` exists;
* `2.example.org` does not exist.

And if `2.example.org` does not exist, `x.2.example.org` also does not exist.
But only if there was no wildcard configured. So this is the last step: Check if
there is a wildcard configured at the closest encloser. 

The resolver
hashes `*.example.org` to `22670TRPLHSR72PQQMEDLTG1KDQEOLB7`. Only the last
NSEC3 covers this hash. The hash falls in
the interval set by `1AVVQN74SG75UKFVF25DGCETHGQ638EK` and
`75B9ID679QQOV6LDFHD8OCSHSSSB6JVQ` (this is our third NSEC3).
This means there is no wildcard
at the closest encloser and `x.2.example.org` definitely does not exist.

When we have validated the signatures, we reached our goal: authenticated denial
of existence.

Coming back to the original question: why do we need (up to) three NSEC3
records? The resolver needs to be explicitly told what the `closest encloser` is
and this takes up a full NSEC3 record. Then the next closer name needs to be covered
in an NSEC3 record, and finally an NSEC3 must say something about the wildcard. That
makes three records.

# Security Considerations
The RFCs describing authenticated denial of existence are concise about why
certain design choices have been made. Implementations that do not correctly
handle this aspect of DNSSEC create a severe hole in the security DNSSEC can add.
This document aims to "fill this documentation gap" and provide would-be
implementors and other interested parties with enough background knowledge to
better understand authenticated denial of existence.
